Custom CSS Editor
=================

This module allows administrators to customize a theme's CSS through
the browser, using a rich text editor with syntax highlighting and
live preview.

On the settings page of each theme it will be displayed a
textarea where the admin can type custom CSS code. He can choose to
use a plain textarea or an editor with syntax highlighting (default).
He can also preview the changes live while he types. This can be disabled
as well (default is enabled). The feature can be enabled to multiple
themes on the same site, and all can be lively previewed, not only the
default one. The custom CSS code is injected after all other CSS.
